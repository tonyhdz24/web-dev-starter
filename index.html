        Currently I work for Boise States Office of Information and Technology
        as a Wordpress support assistant. Even though I primarily use Wordpress
        in my job and rarely have to directly modify any HTML,CSS, or JavaScript
        I do use alot of the concepts that we've learned so far in CS 208. Such
        as making sure that sites are easy and intuitive to navigate, look good,
        and are accessible.
